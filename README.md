## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This app is still a work in progress. I struggled with the grid layout for the radio buttons getting distorted when the type of input for the custom tip amount was changed to text, but solved the problem with the grid gap and row-gap properties.

### Continued development

Work on mobile layout, reset button functionality, being able to change the custom tip amount once it's been entered.

### Useful resources

- [How to change the <input> type?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-change-the-input-type/) - This site helped me understand how to change the type of input from radio button to text for the custom input.
